## WHY USE THESE TECH
FE: React, antd
- **antd:** An enterprise-class UI design language and React UI library with a set of high-quality React components out of the box.

BE: sqlite3, knex, express
- **sqlite3:** SQList is friendly and good for demo, small fast and reliable.

- **knex:** Knex.js is a "batteries included" SQL query builder for SQLite3 *** the most important part is that I should add transaction to the mutations for integrity and consistency.

- [ ] Add transactions to mutations for integrity and consistency.

- **cache:** The cache I add is the temp cache for control table capacity, it is a simple cache, I can use redis or memcached for a better cache.

- [ ] Add redis or memcached for a better cache.

- **typescript:** TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that compiles to clean JavaScript output. I used TypeScript for type checking and better code quality. But in this case I can add ZOD for better type checking.

- [ ] Add ZOD for better type checking. Especially for the input validation for example the date and time.

- ** authentication:** I used JWT for authentication, but I can use OAuth2 for better security.
- [ ] Add OAuth2 for better security.
- [ ] Add role based access control for better security in backend.

Failed in adding test cases with cucumber, should do later on.

There is a lot of things to do, but I think this is a good start.
